1. Definition of Scrum
    1. A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.
        * lightweight
        * simple to understand
        * difficult to master
2. Three pillars
    1. transparency
        * Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.  
        Transparency requires those aspects to be defined by a 
        common standard so obsers share a common understanding of what is being seen
            * ex
                * common language shared by all participants
                * inspectors and workers 
                    * must share a common definition of "Done".
    2. inspection
        * scrum users mush frequentyly inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances.
        * inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work.
        * most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at the point of work
    3. adaptation
        * if inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, 
          and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted.
        * an adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize futher deviation.
