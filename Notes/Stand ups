1. What you did since last time?
	* Wrote a Game and Rooms class
	* Created a database that dumps json file into sqlite3.
		*  mainly just to have everything in one place so if we create a list
		   of items it will be easier to update.
	* made json files that contail story
	* made the mase based on the room class
		* the room class basically makes the maze by calling whats in the json file.
2. What you will do for next time or what you actually accomplish?
	* Create story points json files
	* run tests to break the code that I wrote.

3. Blockers?
	* Trying to conform to the yml file is hard and not easy to get compiled.
		* Need more imput from LA's to have a better understanding.
