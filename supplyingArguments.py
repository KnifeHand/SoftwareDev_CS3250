'''When defining a custom function in Python programming you may, optionally, 
specify an "argument" name between the functions.  The function can now use 
that passed in value during its execution by referencing it via the argument 
name.  For example, defining a function to accept an argument to print out, 
like this:'''
def echo(user):
    print('User:', user)
'''A call to this function must specify a value to be passed to the argument 
within its parentheses so it can be printed out:'''
echo('Mike')
